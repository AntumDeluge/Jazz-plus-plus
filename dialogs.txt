How To Work on Dialogs

Feel free to add to this file as you learn things while porting dialogs.

1.  Find an existing dialog that hasn't been ported.  This is pretty easy to do,
    since most of the dialogs have not yet been ported.  Any dialogs based on
    wxForm or wxPropertyList should be ported to the new XML system.

2.  Create an .xrc file that has the appropriate widgets.  The IDs of the
    widgets will later be used to attach Jazz++ code.  The following widgets
    have special IDs:
        OK Button:     wxID_OK
        Cancel Button: wxID_CANCEL
        Apply Button:  wxID_APPLY

    Place your .xrc file in the dialogs subdirectory.

    Dialogs can be edited with tools such as xrced (that comes with the
    wxWidgets contrib tree), or wxGlade.  xrced is available in the
    libwxgtk2.4-python debian package.  wxGlade is available from the
    wxglade.sourceforge.net site.

3.  Replace the existing dialog C++ with tResourceDialog based code.  In some
    cases, tResourceDialog will need to be extended to support additional
    widget and data types.  Note that there's currently no support for
    non-modal dialogs.  If non-modal dialogs are needed, let Patrick know and
    he can fix up the resource dialog code to support them.

    You will also need to add a line to jazz.cpp that loads your new dialog.
    Search for "LoadResource" in that file.

There are a few things that could be done to ease the creation of dialogs.  I
could provide a list of dialogs that have not yet been ported.  The code could
be moved to the dialogs subdir.  Proper Doxygen documentation could be added
for the tResourceDialog class.
