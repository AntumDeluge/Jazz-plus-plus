ChangeLog for Development Version

03-23-04
-Added the XRC library and make a Makefile.am for it.
-Removed the configure and Makefile.in entries from the CVS.  They keep
 changing, and it's annoying to keep them current in the CVS.

-I forget to make log entries, so this is one huge entry to describe the
 changes I've made over time.  I'm no doubt missing many smaller changes.
-Separated most of tPianoWin from tEventWin.  There are still minor pieces that
 aren't finished, but at least tEventWin is no longer tPianoWin's superclass.
-Fixed a number of issues with coordinate translation in the piano window.
-Fixed some of the redraw stuff and the tMouseCounter update thing.
-Created a new dialog system based on XRC.  The code for that is in resdlg.c
 and resdlg.h.
-Removed the AUDIO #ifdef.  I didn't see much of a reason to complicate the
 code and leave the ability to remove the audio component.  If the audio
 portion of Jazz is broken, it should be either fixed or removed.  If it's
 working, I see no reason to not make it available for use all the time.
 Adding the additional compile time switch just adds complexity to the code.
 If no audio device is available, that condition can be detected and dealt
 with at run-time.
-Fixed the bitmap "make" script.  Also fixed a number of the bitmaps to
 properly handle transparency.
-Integrated patch to support midi devices other than 0.
-Removed all the misused #pragma hdrstop directives.
-Created new XRC Window Settings dialog for the piano and track windows.
-Removed the wxwin2port.h file and properly dealt with any issues that caused.

03-15-04 Patrick Earl
-Rewrote toolbar.cpp and toolbar.h
-Updated all references to toolbar system and removed the crazy tb_ stuff.
-Rewrote the note colourization in the piano window.  Now allocates on stack.
